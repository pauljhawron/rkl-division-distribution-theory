# Rumble Kong League Division Distribution Theory

This project is a data science project done in Python. It was made in a Jupyter Notebook, so reading the .ipynb file in browser should be formatted well. There is a link to my commentary on Twitter about the details of the analysis at the top of the .ipynb file.

This is not as much a typical data science project as it is an enhanced exploratory data analysis to theorize the way the upcoming RKL game might be structured, and what different outcomes would look like. I create some basically mathematical formulas to segment the distribution of elements in the dataset by their features.
